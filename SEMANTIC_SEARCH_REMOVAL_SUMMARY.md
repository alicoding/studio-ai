# Semantic Search Feature Removal Summary

## Date: 2025-07-06

## What was removed:

### Backend Components:

1. `/web/server/api/search.ts` - Search API endpoints
2. `/web/server/services/SimpleSearchService.ts` - Search service implementation
3. `/web/server/mcp/semantic-search/` - Entire MCP server directory

### Frontend Components:

1. `/src/components/search/` - All search UI components
   - `SearchIndexControls.tsx`
   - `SearchSidebarSection.tsx`
2. `/src/services/SimpleSemanticSearch.ts` - Frontend search service
3. `/src/lib/semantic-search/` - Semantic search library

### Other Files:

1. `/scripts/build-semantic-index.ts` - Index building script
2. `/.claude-studio-search-index.json` - Search index file
3. `/.studio-search-index/` - Search index directory
4. `/semantic-search-standalone/` - Standalone implementation

### Package.json Changes:

1. Removed `@xenova/transformers` dependency
2. Removed `build-semantic-index` script

### Code Changes:

1. Removed search router import and usage from `/web/server/app.ts`
2. Removed `SearchIndexControls` usage from:
   - `/src/components/projects/ViewControls.tsx`
   - `/src/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`
3. Removed `SearchSidebarSection` from `/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
4. Removed `onFileSelect` prop from Sidebar component
5. Removed `handleFileSelect` function from `/src/routes/index.tsx`

## Why it was removed:

1. **Broken Architecture**: Backend was importing from frontend (`SimpleSearchService` importing from `src/services/`)
2. **Non-functional MCP**: The MCP server degraded to simple text matching instead of actual semantic search
3. **Missing Source Files**: Only compiled JavaScript existed for MCP, no TypeScript sources
4. **Poor Implementation**: The implementation violated separation of concerns and wasn't properly structured

## Result:

- All TypeScript errors related to search have been resolved
- The codebase is cleaner without the broken implementation
- Ready for a proper semantic search implementation if needed in the future

## Lines of Code Removed: ~1,500+ lines
