# Studio AI

**The Universal AI Agent Orchestration Platform**

Studio AI enables asynchronous communication and collaboration between AI coding agents through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Orchestrate Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and future AI agents to work together on complex software projects.

## üéØ Core Innovation

Studio AI is the **first platform** that allows different AI coding agents to:

- **Communicate asynchronously** through MCP-based message passing
- **Share context and outputs** between different AI systems (Claude ‚Üí Gemini ‚Üí Custom)
- **Build workflows programmatically** - AI agents can create workflows for other agents
- **Work autonomously** on scheduled tasks and complex multi-step projects

Think of it as **n8n for AI consciousness** - but instead of connecting APIs, you're connecting AI minds.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/alicoding/studio-ai.git
cd studio-ai
npm install

# Configure your AI agents
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys (Anthropic, Google, etc.)

# Start the platform
npm run dev
```

## üí° What Can You Build?

### Example: Multi-Agent Code Review

```javascript
// Claude architect designs, Gemini implements, Claude reviews
{
  workflow: [
    {
      id: 'design',
      agent: 'claude_architect',
      task: 'Design the authentication system',
    },
    {
      id: 'implement',
      agent: 'gemini_developer',
      task: 'Implement based on: {design.output}',
      deps: ['design'],
    },
    {
      id: 'review',
      agent: 'claude_reviewer',
      task: 'Review implementation: {implement.output}',
      deps: ['implement'],
    },
  ]
}
```

**Built by developers, for AI agents** ü§ñ

Studio AI is currently in **alpha**. We're building this in public and would love your feedback and contributions.

_Frustrated with copy-pasting between AI tools? So were we. That's why we built Studio AI._
