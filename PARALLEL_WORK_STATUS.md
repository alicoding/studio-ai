# Parallel Agent Work - Implementation Status

## âœ… What's Already Working

### 1. Inter-Agent Communication (@mentions)
- Frontend detects @mentions in messages
- Routes through `/api/messages/mention`
- MessageRouter parses mentions
- WebSocket broadcasts to UI
- Each agent can see mentions directed at them

### 2. Multi-Agent Views
- Split view for 2 agents
- Grid view for 4 agents  
- Each agent has independent chat/terminal

### 3. Process Management
- Spawn multiple agents per project
- Track agent status (online/busy/offline)
- Kill/restart agents as needed

## ðŸ”§ What's Needed for True Parallel Work

### 1. Branch Management per Agent
```typescript
interface AgentWorkspace {
  agentId: string
  branch: string // feature/agent-frontend-work
  files: string[] // Files agent is working on
  status: 'working' | 'ready-for-review' | 'blocked'
}
```

### 2. Work Coordination Service
```typescript
class WorkCoordinator {
  // Prevent conflicts
  claimFiles(agentId: string, files: string[]): boolean
  releaseFiles(agentId: string, files: string[]): void
  
  // Track progress
  updateProgress(agentId: string, task: string, progress: number): void
  
  // Coordinate merges
  requestMerge(agentId: string, targetBranch: string): PullRequest
}
```

### 3. Task Distribution
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string
  description: string
  assignedTo?: string
  dependencies?: string[]
  files?: string[]
  branch?: string
}
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Implementation

### Phase 1: Branch-per-Agent
1. When spawning agent, create feature branch
2. Set agent's working directory to that branch
3. Track which branch each agent is on

### Phase 2: File Locking
1. Simple file claim system
2. UI shows which files are "in use"
3. Prevent conflicts

### Phase 3: Work Visualization
1. Show agent progress in UI
2. Branch status indicators
3. Merge readiness

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Human: "Let's build a user profile feature"

# System creates tasks:
Task 1: Create UserProfile component (Frontend Agent)
Task 2: Create /api/users/profile endpoint (Backend Agent)  
Task 3: Write tests for profile (Test Agent)

# Each agent:
1. Gets assigned a task
2. Creates feature branch (feature/user-profile-frontend)
3. Claims relevant files
4. Works independently
5. Creates PR when done

# Coordination:
- Agents can @mention each other for questions
- File locking prevents conflicts
- Automatic PR creation when ready
- Human reviews and merges
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Branch Management** (Critical)
   - Each agent on own branch
   - Prevent conflicts

2. **Task Queue** (Important)
   - Distribute work automatically
   - Track progress

3. **PR Workflow** (Nice to have)
   - Auto-create PRs
   - AI reviewers

This gives us true parallel development!
