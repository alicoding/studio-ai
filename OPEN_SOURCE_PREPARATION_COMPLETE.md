## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What Studio AI Is Now

**Studio AI** is an extensible AI development platform that enables visual workflow creation with multiple AI providers. Think "n8n for AI development" - a visual, node-based system for building complex AI workflows.

### Key Features for Open Source

1. **Visual Workflow Builder** - Drag-and-drop interface for AI workflows
2. **Multi-Provider Support** - Claude, GPT, Gemini (architecture ready)
3. **Conditional Logic** - Advanced branching with structured conditions
4. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate different AI agents
5. **Community Marketplace** - Extensible node system for sharing
6. **Docker Deployment** - Production-ready containerization

### Target Market

- **Developers** building AI-powered applications
- **Enterprises** automating workflows with AI
- **Community** creating and sharing AI workflow templates
- **Competitors** to Zapier, n8n, but focused on AI orchestration

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Frontend

- **React + TypeScript** - Modern, type-safe UI
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing
- **Zustand** - State management
- **React Flow** - Visual workflow builder

### Backend

- **Express + TypeScript** - RESTful API server
- **LangGraph** - Workflow orchestration engine
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** - Flexible database support
- **Socket.IO** - Real-time updates

### Deployment

- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container setup
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **Redis** - Cross-server communication
- **PostgreSQL** - Production database

## 📁 Example Workflows

### 1. Testing Automation

**Location:** `/examples/testing-automation/`

- Multi-stage testing pipeline
- Conditional deployment based on test results
- Quality gates with structured conditions
- Performance and security testing integration

### 2. Approval Workflows

**Location:** `/examples/approval-workflows/`

- Human-in-the-loop decision making
- Multi-level approval chains
- Timeout handling and escalation
- Integration with communication tools

## 🌟 Unique Value Propositions

1. **AI-First Design** - Built specifically for AI workflow orchestration
2. **Visual Interface** - No-code/low-code approach to AI workflows
3. **Multi-Provider** - Not locked into a single AI provider
4. **Community Driven** - Extensible marketplace for sharing workflows
5. **Enterprise Ready** - Docker deployment, security, scalability
