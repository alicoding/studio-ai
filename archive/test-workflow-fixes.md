# Workflow Builder Bug Fixes - Test Plan

## âœ… Implemented Fixes

### 1. Node Re-addition Bug Fix

- **Problem**: Adding node â†’ removing â†’ re-adding restored deleted nodes
- **Solution**: Enhanced `onNodesChange` handler bridges React Flow changes to store
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `onNodesChangeOriginal` to handle display updates
  - Added store sync for `remove` type changes
  - Proper bidirectional communication between display and store

### 2. CMD+A Select All with Visual Feedback

- **Problem**: No keyboard support for selecting all nodes + no visual feedback
- **Solution**: Added keyboard event handlers with proper visual synchronization
- **Implementation**:
  - `CMD+A` / `CTRL+A` selects all nodes with visual styling
  - Only active when canvas is focused (not in text inputs)
  - Bidirectional sync between store state and React Flow visual state

### 3. Mouse Drag Selection

- **Problem**: No drag selection for multiple nodes
- **Solution**: Enabled React Flow's selection box with proper interaction modes
- **Implementation**:
  - `selectionOnDrag={true}` enables selection box
  - `panOnDrag={[1, 2]}` allows right-click and middle-click pan
  - `SelectionMode.Partial` for flexible selection

### 4. Node Position Persistence

- **Problem**: Nodes constantly re-arrange to default positions due to store recreation
- **Solution**: Added position storage in workflow builder store
- **Implementation**:
  - `nodePositions` state stores all node positions permanently
  - `updateNodePosition()` saves position changes during drag
  - `stepsToNodes()` uses stored positions or defaults for new nodes
  - Positions persist across store updates and component re-renders

### 5. Edge Arrow Markers

- **Problem**: Workflow edges had no directional indicators
- **Solution**: Added proper arrow markers to all edges
- **Implementation**:
  - `MarkerType.ArrowClosed` with consistent styling
  - Color: `#64748b`, stroke width: `2px`
  - Applied to all dependency edges

### 6. Delete Key Support

- **Problem**: No keyboard support for deleting nodes
- **Solution**: Added Delete/Backspace key handling
- **Implementation**:
  - `Delete` / `Backspace` keys delete selected nodes
  - Only works when nodes are selected
  - Properly removes nodes and their dependencies

### 7. Canvas Focus Management

- **Problem**: No proper focus management for keyboard events
- **Solution**: Added proper canvas focus and event handling
- **Implementation**:
  - `onPaneClick` focuses canvas for keyboard shortcuts
  - `tabIndex={0}` makes canvas focusable
  - Event listeners only active when appropriate

### 8. Enhanced Store Selection State

- **Problem**: No bulk selection support
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive selection state management
- **Implementation**:
  - `selectedStepIds` array tracks multiple selections
  - `selectAllSteps()`, `clearSelection()`, `deleteSelectedSteps()` methods
  - Proper state synchronization between store and display

### 9. Trackpad Navigation Controls

- **Problem**: Trackpad only zoomed, couldn't pan/scroll in different directions
- **Solution**: Configured proper React Flow trackpad and scroll behavior
- **Implementation**:
  - `panOnScroll={true}` enables trackpad scrolling for panning
  - `zoomOnPinch={true}` enables pinch-to-zoom gestures
  - `panOnScrollMode={PanOnScrollMode.Free}` allows free-direction panning
  - `zoomOnScroll={true}` with scroll wheel zoom
  - `preventScrolling={false}` allows natural trackpad behavior

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Node Re-addition Bug

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add a node (e.g., "Developer")
3. Delete the node
4. Add a new node
5. âœ… **Expected**: Only new node appears (deleted node stays deleted)

### Test 2: CMD+A Select All with Visual Feedback

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes (3-4 nodes)
3. Click on canvas to focus
4. Press CMD+A (Mac) or CTRL+A (Windows/Linux)
5. âœ… **Expected**: All nodes become selected WITH visual selection styling

### Test 3: Mouse Drag Selection

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes spread across canvas
3. Click and drag to create selection box around multiple nodes
4. âœ… **Expected**: All nodes within selection box become selected

### Test 4: Multi-Selection with CMD/CTRL+Click

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes
3. Click first node to select
4. Hold CMD/CTRL and click other nodes
5. âœ… **Expected**: Multiple nodes selected simultaneously

### Test 5: Delete Key Functionality

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes
3. Select nodes (any method: click, drag, CMD+A, etc.)
4. Press Delete or Backspace
5. âœ… **Expected**: Selected nodes are deleted

### Test 6: ESC Key Clear Selection

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes
3. Select multiple nodes (any method)
4. Press ESC key
5. âœ… **Expected**: All selections cleared with visual feedback

### Test 7: Canvas Click Clear Selection

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add multiple nodes
3. Select multiple nodes
4. Click on empty canvas area
5. âœ… **Expected**: All selections cleared

### Test 8: Input Focus Handling

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add nodes
3. Click on workflow name input field
4. Try CMD+A while in text input
5. âœ… **Expected**: Text selection works, nodes not affected

### Test 9: Canvas Focus Management

1. Open workflow builder
2. Add nodes
3. Click on empty canvas area
4. Press keyboard shortcuts
5. âœ… **Expected**: Canvas gets focus, keyboard shortcuts work

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Node re-addition bug is fixed
- [ ] CMD+A selects all nodes with visual feedback
- [ ] Mouse drag selection works for multiple nodes
- [ ] CMD/CTRL+Click multi-selection works
- [ ] Delete key removes selected nodes
- [ ] ESC key clears selection with visual feedback
- [ ] Canvas click clears selection
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts don't interfere with text inputs
- [ ] Canvas focus management works properly
- [ ] Store state properly synchronized with React Flow visual state

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Manual testing with actual workflow builder UI
2. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. Test with various node types (Task, Conditional, etc.)
4. Test edge cases (empty workflow, single node, etc.)
5. Performance testing with large workflows

## ðŸ“š Technical Details

### Files Modified:

- `src/stores/workflowBuilder.ts` - Added selection state and bulk operations
- `src/components/workflow-builder/VisualWorkflowBuilder.tsx` - Enhanced node management and keyboard handling

### Key Patterns Used:

- **SOLID**: Single responsibility for each method
- **DRY**: Reused existing store patterns
- **KISS**: Simple keyboard event handling
- **Library-First**: Used React Flow's built-in event system

### Architecture:

- Store-driven state management
- Proper event handler cleanup
- Focus management best practices
- Type-safe implementations
