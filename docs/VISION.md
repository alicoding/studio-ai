# Studio AI Vision & Roadmap

**Visual AI Workflow Platform**

## üéØ What Studio AI Is

Studio AI is a **visual workflow platform for AI development** that enables developers to create, orchestrate, and manage AI workflows through a drag-and-drop interface.

**Core Purpose**: Provide a visual, collaborative environment for building AI workflows that can coordinate multiple AI agents and integrate with various AI providers.

## üåü Current Capabilities

### What We Have Built

Studio AI provides:

- **Visual Workflow Builder** - Drag-and-drop interface for creating AI workflows
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate multiple AI agents in complex workflows
- **Real-time Execution** - Live monitoring and streaming of workflow execution
- **Conditional Logic** - Advanced branching and decision-making in workflows
- **Project Management** - Organize workflows by projects with team collaboration
- **Template System** - Save and reuse workflow templates

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Platform (Current State)

**Frontend:**

- React + TypeScript with TanStack Router
- React Flow for visual workflow builder
- Zustand for state management
- Socket.IO for real-time updates

**Backend:**

- Express + TypeScript API server
- LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- SQLite/PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Socket.IO for WebSocket communication

**Deployment:**

- Docker Compose setup
- Multi-container architecture
- Production-ready configuration

### Current Node Types

**Task Nodes:**

- Execute AI agent tasks
- Support template variables (`{stepId.output}`)
- Configurable agent roles and prompts

**Conditional Nodes:**

- Structured condition builder
- Support for multiple data types and operations
- Visual branch routing (true/false paths)

**Loop Nodes:**

- Iterate over arrays with variable substitution
- Support for nested workflows
- Configurable iteration limits

### AI Integration

**Claude Integration:**

- Full Claude SDK integration
- Real-time streaming responses
- Session management and persistence
- Tool permissions and restrictions

**Multi-Provider Architecture:**

- Abstracted provider interface
- Support for different AI models
- Configurable provider settings
- Extensible for future providers

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Workflow Execution Engine

**LangGraph Integration:**

- Native workflow orchestration with LangGraph
- StateGraph for complex workflow management
- Checkpoint system for workflow persistence
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Template Variables:**

- Dynamic variable substitution in workflows
- Support for `{stepId.output}` syntax
- Context-aware variable resolution
- Type-safe template processing

### Real-time Communication

**WebSocket Architecture:**

- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Agent status broadcasting
- Workflow execution monitoring
- Message streaming for live chat

**Event System:**

- Centralized event management
- Cross-component communication
- Scalable event distribution
- Redis support for multi-instance deployment

### Data Persistence

**Database Design:**

- SQLite for development
- PostgreSQL for production
- Migration system for schema updates
- Optimized queries for workflow data

**Session Management:**

- Claude SDK session integration
- Persistent chat history
- Project-scoped sessions
- Automatic session cleanup

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

**Docker Deployment (Recommended):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/studio-ai/studio-ai
cd studio-ai
docker-compose up -d
```

**Local Development:**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Project** - Set up your workspace
2. **Add Agents** - Configure AI agents with roles and permissions
3. **Build Workflows** - Drag and drop nodes to create workflows
4. **Execute & Monitor** - Run workflows and monitor real-time execution

### Example Workflows

**Simple AI Task:**

- Task Node ‚Üí Execute AI agent with prompt
- Monitor execution in real-time
- View results in chat interface

**Conditional Logic:**

- Task Node ‚Üí Conditional Node ‚Üí Two Task Nodes
- Branch based on AI agent response
- Different actions for different outcomes

**Multi-Agent Coordination:**

- Multiple Task Nodes with dependencies
- Agents collaborate on complex tasks
- Template variables pass data between steps
