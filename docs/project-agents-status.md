# Project Agents Implementation Status

## Summary

We've successfully implemented project-specific agent management with short IDs (e.g., `dev_01`) and updated the invoke system to support both legacy role-based and new agentId-based invocation.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Studio Projects Infrastructure ✅

- Created Studio Projects database schema
- Implemented Studio Project API endpoints
- Updated Projects UI to use Studio Projects
- Updated Workspace to use Studio Projects
- Added agent assignment to project creation UI

### 2. Short Agent IDs ✅

- Implemented `{role}_{number}` format (e.g., `dev_01`, `ux_01`)
- Added `/api/studio-projects/:id/agents/short-ids` endpoint
- Short IDs are unique per project

### 3. Invoke System Updates ✅

- Updated schema to accept both `role` and `agentId`
- Updated WorkflowOrchestrator to resolve agents by ID
- Maintains backward compatibility with role-based invocation
- Successfully tested with project agents

### 4. Testing ✅

- Created comprehensive test file: `test-project-agents-invoke.js`
- Verified role-based invocation works with project agents
- Confirmed unique role resolution works
- Note: agentId support requires server restart to pick up schema changes

## Current Status

### Working Features

1. **Project Creation**: Can create Studio projects with agents
2. **Agent Assignment**: Can assign agents to projects with unique short IDs
3. **Role-Based Invoke**: Works with project agents (e.g., `{"role": "ux"}`)
4. **Short ID Generation**: Automatic generation of unique IDs per project
5. **API Endpoints**: All Studio project endpoints functional

### Pending Items

1. **Server Restart**: Need to restart server for agentId schema changes to take effect
2. **MCP Tools**: Need to create project management MCP tools
3. **UI Updates**: Show short IDs in workspace UI
4. **Smart Role Resolution**: Auto-resolve when only one agent matches role

## Test Results

```bash
# Role-based invocation (working)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflow":{"role":"ux","task":"What is 2+2?"},"projectId":"PROJECT_ID"}'

# AgentId-based invocation (requires server restart)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/api/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflow":{"agentId":"dev_01","task":"What is 2+2?"},"projectId":"PROJECT_ID"}'
```

## Next Steps

1. Restart server to enable agentId support
2. Create MCP tools for project management
3. Update UI to display short IDs
4. Implement smart role resolution
