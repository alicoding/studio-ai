# User Dashboard Feature Requirements

## Overview
The User Dashboard is a centralized workspace view that provides users with an at-a-glance summary of their activities, key metrics, quick access to common actions, and notifications. This feature will be integrated into the Claude Studio workspace following the workspace-centric design principle.

## Feature Components

### 1. Recent Activity Timeline
A chronological feed showing user's recent actions and interactions within Claude Studio.

### 2. Key Metrics Widgets
Customizable widgets displaying important statistics and performance indicators.

### 3. Quick Action Buttons
One-click access to frequently used features and workflows.

### 4. Notification Center
Centralized hub for system notifications, updates, and alerts.

## User Stories

### US-1: View Recent Activity
**As a** Claude Studio user  
**I want to** see my recent activities in a timeline format  
**So that** I can quickly review what I've been working on and resume tasks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Timeline displays activities from the last 30 days by default
- Each activity item shows: timestamp, action type, related entities (files, projects, etc.)
- Activities are grouped by day with clear date headers
- Users can filter activities by type (file edits, API calls, workspace changes, etc.)
- Users can search within their activity history
- Timeline supports pagination for older activities
- Clicking an activity item navigates to the relevant resource

### US-2: Monitor Key Metrics
**As a** Claude Studio user  
**I want to** view important metrics about my usage and performance  
**So that** I can understand my productivity and resource utilization

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard displays at least 4 default metric widgets:
  - API usage (calls made, tokens used)
  - Active projects count
  - Files edited today/this week
  - Time spent in workspace
- Each widget shows current value and trend indicator
- Users can add/remove widgets from a predefined set
- Widgets can be rearranged via drag-and-drop
- Clicking a widget opens detailed analytics view
- Metrics update in real-time or near real-time
- Data visualization uses charts where appropriate

### US-3: Access Quick Actions
**As a** Claude Studio user  
**I want to** quickly start common tasks from the dashboard  
**So that** I can work more efficiently without navigating through menus

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard displays a "Quick Actions" section with buttons for:
  - Create new file
  - Open recent project
  - Start new conversation
  - Run saved workflow
  - Open settings
- Quick action buttons show relevant icons and labels
- Users can customize which actions appear (max 8)
- Actions can be reordered based on preference
- Each action has keyboard shortcut displayed on hover
- Recently used actions are highlighted or promoted

### US-4: Manage Notifications
**As a** Claude Studio user  
**I want to** see and manage all my notifications in one place  
**So that** I stay informed about important updates without being overwhelmed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Notification center shows unread count badge
- Notifications are categorized by type:
  - System updates
  - Collaboration mentions
  - Task completions
  - Error alerts
  - API limit warnings
- Each notification shows: icon, title, description, timestamp
- Users can mark notifications as read/unread
- Users can dismiss individual or bulk notifications
- Notification preferences can be configured (which types to show)
- Critical notifications are visually distinguished
- Clicking a notification performs relevant action or navigation

### US-5: Customize Dashboard Layout
**As a** Claude Studio user  
**I want to** customize my dashboard layout  
**So that** I can organize information according to my workflow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard sections can be collapsed/expanded
- Sections can be reordered via drag-and-drop
- Layout preferences persist across sessions
- Users can reset to default layout
- Dashboard supports responsive design for different screen sizes
- Customization mode clearly indicated with edit controls

## Technical Requirements

### Data Requirements
- Activity data stored with user ID, timestamp, action type, and metadata
- Metrics calculated from existing usage data (no new tracking required)
- Notification queue with read/unread status per user
- User preferences stored for layout and widget configuration

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard initial load time < 2 seconds
- Widget data updates without full page refresh
- Activity timeline uses virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Metrics cached with appropriate TTL (5 minutes for most metrics)

### Integration Points
- Integrates with existing Zustand stores for state management
- Uses existing API client services for data fetching
- Follows established component patterns in `src/components/`
- Utilizes existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`

### Security & Privacy
- Dashboard only shows user's own data
- API endpoints require authentication
- Sensitive data (API keys, etc.) never displayed in widgets
- Activity history respects workspace privacy settings

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Layout
- Dashboard uses a grid system for responsive widget placement
- Sidebar navigation remains accessible
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark/light theme support following system preferences

### Visual Design
- Consistent with Claude Studio design system
- Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate spacing
- Loading states for all async data
- Empty states with helpful guidance
- Error states with actionable messages

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Dashboard Structure
- Basic dashboard layout component
- Integration with workspace
- Recent activity timeline (basic version)

### Phase 2: Metrics & Widgets
- Key metrics widgets implementation
- Widget customization capability
- Real-time data updates

### Phase 3: Quick Actions & Notifications
- Quick action buttons with customization
- Notification center with categorization
- Notification preferences

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Advanced filtering and search
- Dashboard layout customization
- Performance optimizations
- Analytics deep-dive views

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: 80% of active users access dashboard weekly
- Performance: All dashboard loads complete in < 2 seconds
- Customization: 60% of users customize their dashboard
- Notification management: 90% reduction in missed critical alerts
- User satisfaction: Dashboard feature NPS > 40

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system
- API usage tracking service
- Notification service (may need to be created)
- Activity logging system (may need enhancement)

## Open Questions
1. Should dashboard be the default workspace view or optional?
2. What specific metrics are most valuable to users?
3. How long should activity history be retained?
4. Should we support dashboard templates for different user roles?
5. Integration with external services for additional metrics?

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-time User Experience
1. User logs into Claude Studio
2. Dashboard loads with default layout
3. User sees onboarding tooltips explaining each section
4. User completes a quick action successfully

### Scenario 2: Power User Workflow
1. User customizes dashboard with preferred widgets
2. User rearranges layout for optimal workflow
3. User filters activity timeline to specific project
4. Customization persists across sessions

### Scenario 3: Notification Management
1. User receives multiple notifications while away
2. User opens notification center
3. User bulk marks notifications as read
4. User adjusts notification preferences

### Scenario 4: Mobile Experience
1. User accesses dashboard on mobile device
2. Layout adapts to smaller screen
3. All features remain accessible
4. Performance remains acceptable

## Risk Mitigation
- **Performance Risk**: Implement pagination and caching strategies
- **Data Overload**: Provide sensible defaults and filtering options
- **Complexity Risk**: Phase implementation to gather feedback early
- **Integration Risk**: Design with existing patterns and services
