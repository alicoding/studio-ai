# Resume Indicators Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented Phase 4.3 of the workflow visualization plan - Resume Indicators. This feature enhances the visual representation of workflows by clearly marking resume points (failed/blocked steps) and providing UI to understand and trigger workflow resumption.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced WorkflowStepNode Component
**File**: `src/components/workflow/WorkflowStepNode.tsx`

- Added amber ring highlight for resume point nodes
- Added "Resume" badge with Pause icon in node header
- Added "Checkpoint saved" section at bottom of resume point nodes
- Visual indicators make it immediately clear which nodes can be resumed from

### 2. Resume Button in WorkflowDetails
**File**: `src/components/workflow/WorkflowDetails.tsx`

- Added resume button that appears when workflow has resume points
- Shows count of available checkpoints in tooltip
- Click handler displays instructions for resuming with threadId
- Button has loading state for future API integration

### 3. Steps View Integration
**File**: `src/components/workflow/WorkflowStepList.tsx`

- Extended WorkflowStepList to accept resumePoints prop
- Added resume point badges to NodeCard component
- Consistent visual language between Graph and Steps views

## Technical Details

### Resume Point Detection
- Resume points are determined by the backend based on step status
- Steps with status 'failed' or 'blocked' become resume points
- Stored in `WorkflowGraph.execution.resumePoints` array

### Visual Design
- **Color**: Amber theme (amber-500) for all resume indicators
- **Icons**: Pause icon from lucide-react
- **Ring**: `ring-2 ring-amber-500 ring-offset-2` for highlighted nodes
- **Badges**: Consistent amber background with darker text

### Future Integration
The implementation is ready for actual workflow resumption via the invoke API:
- User clicks "Resume Workflow" button
- System calls invoke API with the existing threadId
- Workflow resumes from the checkpoint, re-executing failed/blocked steps

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/workflow/WorkflowStepNode.tsx` - Enhanced node visualization
2. `src/components/workflow/WorkflowDetails.tsx` - Added resume button
3. `src/components/workflow/WorkflowStepList.tsx` - Added resume indicators to steps view
4. `docs/workflow-visualization-plan.md` - Updated documentation

## Next Steps
- Implement actual resume API call when button is clicked
- Add checkpoint metadata display (when it was saved, etc.)
- Consider adding ability to resume from specific checkpoint if multiple exist
- Add visual feedback during resume operation
