# Workflow Builder Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the Workflow Builder feature for Claude Studio. We're following a **gradual evolution approach** - no big bang rewrites, just steady progress.

## 📍 DECISION: What to Do Next (Jan 2025)

**✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Save/Load functionality is working! MCP tools tested and operational.

**🎯 NEXT ACTION: Create Dedicated Workflows Page** (/workflows route)

This is the logical next step because:

- Users need a central place to manage their workflows
- The library modal is great for loading, but not for management
- Enables CRUD operations (edit, clone, delete) on saved workflows
- Sets up foundation for execution history tracking

**Current Capabilities:**

- ✅ Save workflows from builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ Load workflows into builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ List and filter workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Update and delete workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Execute workflows from builder

**Missing UI Features:**

- ✅ Dedicated workflows management page - IMPLEMENTED (/workflows route)
- ✅ Dynamic agent role integration - IMPLEMENTED (no more hardcoded agent nodes)
- ✅ Import executed workflows UI - IMPLEMENTED (ImportExecutedWorkflowsModal)
- ✅ Execution history tracking - IMPLEMENTED (Full API and UI integration)
- ❌ Workflow templates system

## 🎯 Current Status (Jan 2025)

## 🚨 Current Blockers

**None!** Core workflow management system is complete and fully functional. Ready for advanced features like execution history and import UI.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **Saved Workflow Loading Issue** (Jan 13, 2025)

**Problem**: Clicking on saved workflows navigated to `/workspace/{projectId}/workflows/new` but always showed a blank new workflow instead of loading the saved one.

**Root Cause**: Race condition in `src/routes/workspace/$projectId/workflows/new.tsx`. The route component's `useEffect` was always calling `reset()` and `initWorkflow()` when mounting, which cleared any workflow that was loaded by the Sidebar onClick handler.

**Solution**: Modified the route component to check if a workflow is already loaded before initializing a new one:

```typescript
// Only create a fresh workflow if one isn't already loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (!workflow) {
    initWorkflow('Untitled Workflow', 'Project workflow', projectId)
  }
}, [workflow, initWorkflow, projectId])
```

**Result**: Saved workflows now load properly when clicked in the sidebar.
