# Workflow Builder Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the Workflow Builder feature for Claude Studio. We're following a **gradual evolution approach** - no big bang rewrites, just steady progress.

## 📍 DECISION: What to Do Next (Jan 2025)

**✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Save/Load functionality is working! MCP tools tested and operational.

**🎯 NEXT ACTION: Create Dedicated Workflows Page** (/workflows route)

This is the logical next step because:

- Users need a central place to manage their workflows
- The library modal is great for loading, but not for management
- Enables CRUD operations (edit, clone, delete) on saved workflows
- Sets up foundation for execution history tracking

**Current Capabilities:**

- ✅ Save workflows from builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ Load workflows into builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ List and filter workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Update and delete workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Execute workflows from builder

**Missing UI Features:**

- ✅ Dedicated workflows management page - IMPLEMENTED (/workflows route)
- ✅ Dynamic agent role integration - IMPLEMENTED (no more hardcoded agent nodes)
- ❌ Import executed workflows UI
- ❌ Execution history tracking
- ❌ Workflow templates system

## 🎯 Current Status (Jan 2025)

### What's DONE ✅

#### **API Level (Backend) - COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Workflow Storage System** - SQLite implementation with full CRUD
- ✅ **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/workflows/validate` - Validate workflow structure
  - `POST /api/workflows/execute` - Execute workflows
  - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/workflows/saved` - Full CRUD for saved workflows
  - `POST /api/workflows/import/executed/:threadId` - Import single executed workflow
  - `GET /api/workflows/import/executed/available` - List importable workflows
- ✅ **Database Migration** - saved_workflows table created with scope field
- ✅ **Import System** - Convert executed workflows to editable definitions
- ✅ **MCP Tools** - Complete workflow management via MCP:
  - `create_workflow` - Create new workflow definitions
  - `add_workflow_step` - Add steps to workflows

- ✅ **Flexible APIs** - Support for global, project, and cross-project workflows
  - Optional projectId for global workflows
  - Scope field: 'project' | 'global' | 'cross-project'
  - Query by scope: `?scope=global` or `?global=true`
  - Backward compatible: project queries include global workflows

#### **UI Level (Frontend) - PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Visual Workflow Builder** - Canvas-based editor with React Flow
- ✅ **Workflow Builder Store** - State management with Zustand
- ✅ **Node Components** - WorkflowStep, Conditional, Loop nodes

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Gradual Evolution)

### **Step 1: Wire Up Save/Load** 🔧 ✅ COMPLETED

Save/Load functionality has been fully implemented:

1. **Save Button** ✅:
   - Integrated with workflow builder store
   - Calls `/api/workflows/saved` endpoint
   - Shows loading state and feedback
   - Supports both project and global scopes
   - Preserves workflow state after saving

2. **Load Functionality** ✅:
   - Modal-based workflow selection UI
   - Fetches workflows from `/api/workflows/saved`
   - Shows workflow details (name, description, step count, update date)
   - Loads selected workflow into builder
   - Handles both project-specific and global workflows

**Implementation Details**:

- Added `saveWorkflow()` and `fetchSavedWorkflows()` to store
- Added `isSaving` state for UI feedback
- Created workflow selection modal with proper TypeScript types
- Integrated with existing ModalLayout component
- All TypeScript/ESLint checks passing

**Ready for Testing**:

- ✅ API: Tested with curl - all endpoints working
- ✅ UI: TypeScript/ESLint checks passing
- ✅ Implementation: Save/load functionality fully integrated

### **Step 2: Dedicated Workflows Page** 📄 ✅ COMPLETED

**IMPLEMENTED** `/workflows` route with full workflow management:

```
/workflows ✅ WORKING
├── List all saved workflows (table/cards view) ✅
├── Actions per workflow: ✅
│   ├── Edit → Load into builder ✅
│   ├── Clone → Create copy with new name ✅
│   ├── Delete → Remove (with confirmation) ✅
│   ├── Execute → Run workflow ✅
│   └── View History → See execution runs ⏳
├── "New Workflow" button → Opens builder ✅
├── Search/filter functionality ✅
│   ├── By name/description ✅
│   ├── By scope (project/global) ✅
│   ├── By tags ✅
│   └── By last modified ✅
└── Bulk actions (select multiple) ✅
```

**✅ VERIFIED WITH TESTING**:

- **API Testing**: All CRUD endpoints working (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
- **UI Testing**: Search, filters, table/grid view, navigation all functional
- **Integration**: Proper routing between /workflows and edit modes
- **Scope Handling**: Global vs project workflows correctly managed
- **State Management**: Clean isolation between workflow contexts

### **Step 3: Basic Execution History** 📊

Track where workflows were executed:

```
Workflow Details:
├── Definition (name, steps, etc.)
├── Execution History
│   ├── Timestamp
│   ├── Status (success/failed)
│   └── Thread ID (link to details)
```

**Testing**:

- Executions are tracked ⏳
- Can see history per workflow ⏳

## 🎯 What We're NOT Building Yet

### **Defer for Later:**

- ❌ Cross-project workflows (keep projectId required for now)
- ❌ Global workflow templates
- ❌ Advanced node types (stick with current 3)
- ❌ Complex activity reorganization
- ❌ Workflow marketplace

### **Use What We Have:**

- ✅ LangGraph for execution (no custom engine)
- ✅ Current node types (task, conditional, loop)
- ✅ Existing agent system (no new abstractions)

4. **Scope**: Project-specific first, global later
5. **Focus**: Make basics work perfectly

## 🚨 Current Blockers

**None!** Core workflow management system is complete and fully functional. Ready for advanced features like execution history and import UI.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **Saved Workflow Loading Issue** (Jan 13, 2025)

**Problem**: Clicking on saved workflows navigated to `/workspace/{projectId}/workflows/new` but always showed a blank new workflow instead of loading the saved one.

**Root Cause**: Race condition in `src/routes/workspace/$projectId/workflows/new.tsx`. The route component's `useEffect` was always calling `reset()` and `initWorkflow()` when mounting, which cleared any workflow that was loaded by the Sidebar onClick handler.

**Solution**: Modified the route component to check if a workflow is already loaded before initializing a new one:

```typescript
// Only create a fresh workflow if one isn't already loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (!workflow) {
    initWorkflow('Untitled Workflow', 'Project workflow', projectId)
  }
}, [workflow, initWorkflow, projectId])
```

**Result**: Saved workflows now load properly when clicked in the sidebar.

### **Key Principles**

1. **Incremental**: Each step adds immediate value
2. **User-Centric**: Focus on real needs, not features
3. **API-First**: Backend flexibility enables UI evolution
4. **Production-Ready**: Each increment is polished, not prototype

## 🎓 Key Insight: API-First Approach Working!

Your vision of building flexible APIs first is paying off:

- ✅ APIs support global/project/cross-project workflows
- ✅ No UI constraints limiting the API design
- ✅ Can evolve UI gradually without API changes
- ✅ Ready for future n8n-like capabilities

The foundation is solid. Now we just need to connect the wires!
