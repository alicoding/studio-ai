# Workflow Builder Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the Workflow Builder feature for Claude Studio. We're following a **gradual evolution approach** - no big bang rewrites, just steady progress.

## 📍 DECISION: What to Do Next (Jan 2025)

**✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Save/Load functionality is working! MCP tools tested and operational.

**🎯 NEXT ACTION: Create Dedicated Workflows Page** (/workflows route)

This is the logical next step because:

- Users need a central place to manage their workflows
- The library modal is great for loading, but not for management
- Enables CRUD operations (edit, clone, delete) on saved workflows
- Sets up foundation for execution history tracking

**Current Capabilities:**

- ✅ Save workflows from builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ Load workflows into builder (UI + MCP)
- ✅ List and filter workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Update and delete workflows (API + MCP)
- ✅ Execute workflows from builder

**Missing UI Features:**

- ✅ Dedicated workflows management page - IMPLEMENTED (/workflows route)
- ✅ Dynamic agent role integration - IMPLEMENTED (no more hardcoded agent nodes)
- ✅ Import executed workflows UI - IMPLEMENTED (ImportExecutedWorkflowsModal)
- ✅ Execution history tracking - IMPLEMENTED (Full API and UI integration)
- ❌ Workflow templates system

## 🎯 Current Status (Jan 2025)

### What's DONE ✅

#### **API Level (Backend) - COMPLETE**

## 🚀 Next Priorities (After Execution History Completion)

### **✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE**: All Core Features Working!

The workflow builder foundation is now complete with:

- ✅ Visual workflow builder with save/load
- ✅ Dedicated workflows management page (/workflows)
- ✅ Import executed workflows functionality
- ✅ Full execution history tracking with rich UI

### **🎯 NEXT PRIORITY: Workflow Templates System**

**Why Templates Next:**

- Users need reusable workflow patterns
- Common patterns should be shareable across projects
- Enables rapid workflow creation from proven templates
- Foundation for community/team workflow sharing

**Template System Requirements:**

```
Templates Functionality:
├── Mark workflows as templates ✨
├── Template library/marketplace view ✨
├── Create workflow from template ✨
├── Template categories and tags ✨
├── Template preview and details ✨
└── Template versioning (future) ⏳
```

### **🔄 Implementation Strategy: Gradual Evolution**

**Phase 1: Basic Templates (High Priority)**

1. Add `isTemplate` flag to workflow UI
2. Template filtering in workflows page
3. "Create from Template" functionality
4. Template preview modal

**Phase 2: Enhanced Templates (Medium Priority)**

1. Template categories and tags
2. Template description and metadata
3. Template usage statistics
4. Community templates (global scope)

**Phase 3: Advanced Templates (Future)**

1. Template versioning system
2. Template marketplace features
3. Template forking and customization
4. Team template sharing

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Gradual Evolution)

### **Step 1: Wire Up Save/Load** 🔧 ✅ COMPLETED

Save/Load functionality has been fully implemented:

1. **Save Button** ✅:
   - Integrated with workflow builder store
   - Calls `/api/workflows/saved` endpoint
   - Shows loading state and feedback
   - Supports both project and global scopes
   - Preserves workflow state after saving

2. **Load Functionality** ✅:
   - Modal-based workflow selection UI
   - Fetches workflows from `/api/workflows/saved`
   - Shows workflow details (name, description, step count, update date)
   - Loads selected workflow into builder
   - Handles both project-specific and global workflows

**Implementation Details**:

- Added `saveWorkflow()` and `fetchSavedWorkflows()` to store

├── Actions per workflow: ✅
│   ├── Edit → Load into builder ✅
│   ├── Clone → Create copy with new name ✅
│   ├── Delete → Remove (with confirmation) ✅
│   ├── Execute → Run workflow ✅
│   └── View History → See execution runs ⏳

5. **Focus**: Make basics work perfectly

## 🚨 Current Blockers

**None!** Core workflow management system is complete and fully functional. Ready for advanced features like execution history and import UI.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### **Saved Workflow Loading Issue** (Jan 13, 2025)

**Problem**: Clicking on saved workflows navigated to `/workspace/{projectId}/workflows/new` but always showed a blank new workflow instead of loading the saved one.

**Root Cause**: Race condition in `src/routes/workspace/$projectId/workflows/new.tsx`. The route component's `useEffect` was always calling `reset()` and `initWorkflow()` when mounting, which cleared any workflow that was loaded by the Sidebar onClick handler.

**Solution**: Modified the route component to check if a workflow is already loaded before initializing a new one:

```typescript
// Only create a fresh workflow if one isn't already loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (!workflow) {
    initWorkflow('Untitled Workflow', 'Project workflow', projectId)
  }
}, [workflow, initWorkflow, projectId])
```

**Result**: Saved workflows now load properly when clicked in the sidebar.

## 🎓 Key Insight: API-First Approach Working!

Your vision of building flexible APIs first is paying off:

- ✅ APIs support global/project/cross-project workflows
- ✅ No UI constraints limiting the API design
- ✅ Can evolve UI gradually without API changes
- ✅ Ready for future n8n-like capabilities

The foundation is solid. Now we just need to connect the wires!
