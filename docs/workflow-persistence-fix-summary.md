# Workflow Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem

When saving a workflow and refreshing the browser:

- Text content reverted to default placeholder text
- Node positions were preserved correctly

## Root Cause

The workflow builder uses two storage systems that were conflicting:

1. **Browser Storage (Zustand persist)** - Automatically saves/loads state from browser storage
2. **Backend Database (SQLite)** - Stores workflows when explicitly saved

On page refresh, the browser's persisted state (which had stale data) was overriding the fresh data loaded from the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `clearPersistedState` Method

```typescript
// src/stores/workflowBuilder.ts
clearPersistedState: () => {
  // Clear browser storage
  localStorage.removeItem('claude-studio-workflow-builder')
  sessionStorage.removeItem(storeName)

  // Reset state to initial values
  set({ workflow: null, isDirty: false, ... })
}
```

### 2. Updated `loadWorkflow` Method

```typescript
loadWorkflow: (workflow) => {
  // Clear browser storage to prevent conflicts
  localStorage.removeItem('claude-studio-workflow-builder')
  sessionStorage.removeItem(storeName)

  // Force complete state replacement
  set({ workflow, isDirty: false, ... })
}
```

### 3. Modified Edit Route

```typescript
// src/routes/workflows/$workflowId.edit.tsx
// Clear persisted state BEFORE loading from database
clearPersistedState()
const savedWorkflow = await loadWorkflow(workflowId)
loadWorkflowDefinition(savedWorkflow.definition)
```

## How It Works

1. When editing a saved workflow, we first clear any browser-persisted state
2. Then we load fresh data from the database
3. The database data completely replaces any stale browser state
4. This ensures the saved workflow data (including text content) is properly loaded

## Testing Instructions

1. Create a new workflow
2. Add nodes and change their text (e.g., "Test" instead of default)
3. Save the workflow
4. Refresh the browser
5. The custom text should now persist correctly

## Console Logs for Debugging

The following logs help track the data flow:

- `[WorkflowEdit] Clearing persisted state before loading workflow`
- `[WorkflowEdit] Loading workflow from database: {id}`
- `[WorkflowBuilder] Loading workflow: {data}`
- `[WorkflowBuilder] Workflow loaded successfully, steps: {steps}`
