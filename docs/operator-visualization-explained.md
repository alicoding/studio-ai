# ElectronHub AI Operator Visualization

## Understanding the Operator

The **SimpleOperator** (ElectronHub AI) is a critical component in Claude Studio workflows that:
1. **Evaluates** the output from each Claude agent
2. **Determines** if the step succeeded, failed, or is blocked
3. **Routes** the workflow based on this evaluation

## Visual Representation

### Operator Nodes
- **Shape**: Diamond (45° rotated square)
- **Color**: Purple theme
- **Icons**: CPU and GitBranch icons
- **Label**: "ElectronHub AI"
- **Status Display**: Shows "Status: SUCCESS/BLOCKED/FAILED"

### Workflow Flow
```
[Claude Agent] → [Operator] → [Next Claude Agent]
     Step 1        Evaluate         Step 2
```

### Edge Types
1. **Step → Operator**: Shows output being sent for evaluation
   - Label: "Output →"
   - Style: Regular dependency edge

2. **Operator → Next Step**: Shows routing decision
   - SUCCESS: Green edge labeled "Continue"
   - FAILED: Orange dashed edge labeled "Retry" (for loops)
   - BLOCKED: Red edge (workflow stops)

## How It Works

### 1. Output Evaluation
When a Claude agent completes a task, the SimpleOperator:
- Receives the agent's output text
- Analyzes it using ElectronHub AI
- Looks for success indicators, errors, or blocking issues

### 2. Status Determination
The operator returns one of three statuses:
- **SUCCESS**: Output fulfills the task requirements
- **BLOCKED**: Agent cannot proceed (missing dependencies, access issues)
- **FAILED**: Errors, empty output, or doesn't address the task

### 3. Workflow Routing
Based on the status:
- **SUCCESS**: Workflow continues to the next step
- **BLOCKED**: Workflow pauses, may need manual intervention
- **FAILED**: May trigger a retry loop or error handling

## Example Scenarios

### Success Flow
```
Developer: "Here is the implemented user authentication..."
Operator: Status: SUCCESS
→ Continue to Reviewer
```

### Blocked Flow
```
Developer: "Cannot access database without connection string"
Operator: Status: BLOCKED
→ Workflow stops
```

### Failed with Loop
```
Reviewer: "Found critical security issues in the code"
Operator: Status: FAILED
→ Loop back to Developer
```

## Configuration

The SimpleOperator is configured via:
- Model: Configurable (default uses ElectronHub)
- System Prompt: Context-aware evaluation criteria
- API Keys: ElectronHub API credentials

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Routing**: Workflows adapt based on actual output quality
2. **Error Detection**: Automatically catches failures and blocks
3. **Loop Control**: Creates retry cycles when needed
4. **Transparency**: Visual representation shows decision points

## Test Commands

```bash
# Basic operator evaluation demo
node test-operator-evaluation.js

# Failure handling demo
node test-operator-evaluation.js failure

# Loop pattern demo
node test-workflow-operator-loop.js
```

## Key Takeaways

- The operator is NOT just a data pipe - it's an intelligent evaluator
- Every step output goes through operator evaluation
- Operator decisions control the workflow path
- Visual nodes show exactly where these decisions happen
- This creates self-correcting, adaptive workflows
