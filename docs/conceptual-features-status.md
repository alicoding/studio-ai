# Claude Studio: Conceptual Features & Implementation Status (CORRECTED)

## Overview
This document tracks what's actually implemented vs conceptual in Claude Studio. Previous analysis incorrectly assumed many features were missing when they're actually implemented differently than originally planned.

## 1. **Hooks System** (~85% Complete)

### ✅ Implemented & Working:
- Native Claude Code hooks integration (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop)
- Hook management UI with multi-tier scopes (Studio, Project, System)
- TypeScript checking hook (with exit code 2 blocking)
- ESLint checking hook
- File locking mechanism
- @mention routing
- Discord notification integration
- Hook scripts stored in `~/.claude-studio/scripts/`
- Hooks configuration saved to `~/.claude/settings.json`

### ❌ Conceptual/Not Implemented:
- **Studio-specific events**: TypeCheckFailed, LintError, FileConflict, AgentHandoff (UI shows them but they don't actually trigger)
- **Advanced hook types**: Only 'command' type works; validation, notification, and studio action types are conceptual
- **Recipe system**: Phase 4 - Common hook configurations library
- **Visual hook builder**: Phase 5 - GUI for non-technical users
- **Hook command validation**: Dangerous pattern detection is in the modal but not enforced server-side

## 2. **Settings Page Tabs**

### ❌ Project Configuration Tab (Placeholder)
- Shows: "Select a project to configure its settings"
- Mentions: Environment variables, disabled tools, project-specific MCP servers
- **Status**: Complete placeholder, no backend implementation

### ❌ Team Templates Tab (UI Only)
- Shows: "No team templates configured"
- "Create Team Template" button only does `console.log('Create team template')`
- **Status**: Can create teams via Teams page, but not through Settings

### ❌ MCP Server Configuration Tab (Coming Soon)
- Shows: "MCP server configuration coming soon"
- Mentions: Connect to databases, APIs, services through MCP
- **Status**: Complete placeholder, no implementation

## 3. **Session Viewer**

### ❌ View Session Details
- Location: `/src/components/sessions/SessionsViewer.tsx` line 163
- View button shows alert: "Viewing session details coming soon"
- **Status**: Delete works, but viewing sessions not implemented

## 4. **Collaboration Modes**

### ❌ Types Defined, No Implementation
- File: `/src/types/collaboration.ts`
- Defines: autonomous, guided, review modes
- Has detailed TypeScript interfaces
- **Status**: Types only, no UI or backend implementation

## 5. **Agent Features**

### ✅ Working:
- Agent spawning and management
- Role assignment for legacy agents
- Multi-select and batch operations
- Session continuity with Claude SDK
- Project-specific tool customization

### ❌ Partially Working:
- **Token tracking**: UI shows token bars but no real data from Claude SDK
- **Agent status**: Shows online/busy/offline but not connected to actual process states
- **Play/Pause buttons**: UI exists but doesn't control actual agent processes

## 6. **Process Management**

### ❌ Not Needed (Architecture Changed)
- Original plan called for ProcessManager/ProcessRegistry/ProcessCleaner
- Current implementation uses Claude SDK instances, not separate processes
- No zombie processes can exist (no processes are spawned)
- The "30+ zombie processes" issue is likely misdiagnosed
- **Status**: Code exists in /lib but is unused because architecture pivoted

## 7. **IPC & Message Queue**

### ✅ Implemented Differently
- **@mention routing**: WORKS via HTTP/WebSocket, not IPC
- **Agent communication**: WORKS through server-routed messages
- **Message delivery**: WORKS via Claude SDK sessions
- **IPC code exists but unused**: Architecture pivoted to monolithic design
- **Message Queue**: UI component only, actual queueing not needed

## 8. **Command System**

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **#team**: Shows team composition
- **#spawn**: Creates new agent configurations
- **#clear**: Clears messages
- **#broadcast**: Sends to all agents
- **#help, #interrupt, #cleanup**: All working
- Commands execute through CommandService with proper handlers
- **Status**: Complete and functional

## 9. **UI Components with Mock Data**

### Partially Functional:
- **AgentCard**: Shows mock status, no real process data
- **MessageQueue**: Shows mock queue, no real queue processing
- **@mention autocomplete**: Shows UI with mock agents
- **Token usage bars**: Shows placeholder percentages

## 10. **Prototype Directory**

### Legacy Prototypes (Not Used)
- `/prototype/` contains early HTML/JS mockups
- `mockup.js` has hardcoded agent data
- These files are not part of the active React application

## Summary Statistics (CORRECTED)

- **Hooks System**: ~85% complete (missing advanced features)
- **Settings Tabs**: 3 of 6 tabs are placeholders
- **Agent Management**: ~90% complete (works via SDK, not processes)
- **Process Management**: Not needed (architecture changed)
- **Commands**: 100% complete
- **@mentions**: 100% complete
- **IPC**: Not needed (monolithic architecture)
- **Overall Application**: ~80-85% functional

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Implement ProcessManager to fix zombie processes (Stage 2)
2. **Priority 2**: Complete IPC system for agent communication (Stage 3)
3. **Priority 3**: Implement command system for agent control (Stage 7)
4. **Nice to Have**: Settings page tabs, session viewer, visual hook builder

## Migration from Original Plan

The project has pivoted significantly from the original `plan.md`:
- ✅ Moved to React + TypeScript (originally planned vanilla JS)
- ✅ Implemented Claude SDK integration early
- ✅ Built sophisticated hooks system (not in original plan)
- ✅ Added multi-page navigation (Projects/Workspace/Agents/Teams)
- ❌ Delayed process management (was Priority 1)
- ❌ Skipped IPC implementation (was core feature)
- ❌ Commands not implemented (was key UX feature)
