# Workflow Resume & Retry Implementation TODO

## Overview

Implement SSE-based real-time progress for MCP, non-blocking workflow execution, automatic retry on failures, and seamless resume capabilities.

## ✅ Completed Implementation (July 9, 2025)

### Key Achievements:

1. **Async Workflow Execution**
   - `POST /api/invoke/async` - Start workflows in background
   - `WorkflowExecutor` singleton manages active workflows
   - Prevents LangGraph promise garbage collection

2. **SSE Real-time Streaming**
   - `GET /api/invoke/stream/:threadId` - Server-Sent Events endpoint
   - EventEmitter bridges Socket.io to SSE clients
   - Recovery-focused events (minimal data for crash recovery)

3. **Status Tracking**
   - `GET /api/invoke-status/status/:threadId` - Check workflow state
   - In-memory status tracking with session IDs
   - Tracks current step and completion status

4. **MCP Tools**
   - `invoke_async` - Start workflows asynchronously
   - `invoke_status` - Check workflow progress
   - Both tools fully integrated and tested

5. **Event System**
   - Dual emission to Socket.io and EventEmitter
   - Event types: step_start, step_complete, workflow_complete
   - Session IDs preserved for each step

### Testing Results:

- ✅ Single and multi-step workflows working
- ✅ Dependencies and sequencing correct
- ✅ Real-time SSE events delivered
- ✅ Status tracking accurate
- ✅ Session preservation functional

## Pre-Work Audit Results

### Key File Locations Identified:

- **SSE Endpoints**: Add to `/web/server/api/invoke.ts` and create `/web/server/api/invoke-sse.ts`
- **WorkflowOrchestrator**: `/web/server/services/WorkflowOrchestrator.ts` (lines 83, 93 for key changes)
- **Status Tracking**: `/web/server/api/invoke-status.ts` (enhance existing endpoint)
- **WebSocket Bridge**: `/web/server/websocket.ts` (reuse for SSE events)

### DRY Opportunities:

- Reuse `StudioSessionService` for workflow session tracking
- Bridge existing WebSocket events to SSE (no duplication)
- Leverage `AbortError` utilities from `/web/server/utils/errorUtils.ts`
- Extend existing UI hooks (`useWebSocket.ts`) for SSE support

### SOLID Fixes Needed:

- Extract WebSocket event emission from WorkflowOrchestrator (SRP violation)
- Add dependency injection to WorkflowOrchestrator constructor
- Create event emitter interface for loose coupling

### Legacy Code Ready for Removal:

- `/web/server/api/projects.ts` (only redirect remains)
- Deleted services already removed from git
- No active file-based configs found

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: claude_studio
      POSTGRES_USER: claude
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:

### 6.3 Database Schema & Migration ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create LangGraph checkpoint schema
  ```sql

  -- workflow_checkpoints.checkpoint_migrations - Schema versioning
  -- workflow_checkpoints.workflow_metadata - Our custom metadata table
  ```
- [x] PostgresSaver.setup() method handles table creation automatically
- [x] Verified tables are created properly in workflow_checkpoints schema

  - [x] Health endpoint reflects active checkpointer

- [ ] **Phase C: Persistence Testing** (IN PROGRESS)
  - [ ] Recovers workflow state after server restart

  })
  ```

### 6.6 Safe Rollout Plan

  - [ ] 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
  - [ ] Monitor at each stage
  - [ ] Keep rollback ready
  - [ ] Document any issues

## Implementation Summary (2025-01-09)

### Phase 6: PostgresSaver Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

1. **PostgreSQL Infrastructure** ✅
   - Docker Compose configuration for postgres:15-alpine
   - Connection pooling service with pg library
   - Health check endpoints
   - Feature flag system (USE_POSTGRES_SAVER)

2. **PostgresSaver Integration** ✅
   - Updated checkpointer.ts to use PostgresSaver.fromConnString()
   - Added automatic setup() call to create tables
   - Fixed schema configuration to use workflow_checkpoints
   - Verified checkpoint saving with 4-5 checkpoints per workflow

3. **Testing Results** ✅
   - Workflows execute successfully with PostgresSaver
   - Template variables ({step1.output}) work correctly
   - Checkpoints are saved to PostgreSQL
   - Health endpoint correctly reports PostgresSaver status

### Phase 1.2: RetryPolicy Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

1. **LangGraph RetryPolicy** ✅
   - Added RetryPolicy configuration to all workflow nodes
   - 3 max attempts with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s)
   - Jitter enabled to prevent thundering herd
   - Smart retry logic: retries transient failures, skips auth/validation errors

2. **Testing** ✅
   - Created test script for retry scenarios
   - Verified workflow execution continues with RetryPolicy
   - Checkpoints saved properly during execution

### Key Learnings:

- PostgresSaver requires setup() to be called to create tables
- Use fromConnString() with schema option, not direct Pool constructor
- Host PostgreSQL can conflict with Docker (port 5432)
- LangGraph handles its own checkpoint schema migrations
- RetryPolicy is configured per node in addNode() options

### Architecture Status:

- **SQLite**: All application data (agents, projects, configs)
- **PostgreSQL**: Only LangGraph workflow checkpoints
- **Persistence**: ✅ PostgresSaver active
- **Retry Logic**: ✅ RetryPolicy configured
- **Auto-Resume**: ✅ WorkflowMonitor implemented (event-based)

### Auto-Resume Implementation Details (2025-01-09)

**Key Components:**

1. **WorkflowMonitor Service** (`/web/server/services/WorkflowMonitor.ts`)
   - Singleton pattern for global workflow tracking
   - Monitors active workflows for stale/silent failures
   - 2-minute timeout for detecting non-responsive workflows
   - Auto-triggers recovery via re-invocation

2. **Event-Based Monitoring** (Not True Heartbeats)
   - Updates on `step_start` and `step_complete` events only
   - No updates during actual Claude SDK execution
   - Problem: Long-running steps (>2 min) appear stale
   - Solution would require true heartbeat during execution

3. **FlowLogger Utility** (`/web/server/utils/FlowLogger.ts`)
   - Self-discovering flow documentation
   - Tracks execution paths at runtime
   - Enabled via LOG_FLOWS=true environment variable
   - Helps avoid manual code tracing

**Documented Execution Flow:**

```
1. Step START
   -> WorkflowMonitor.updateHeartbeat()
2. ClaudeService.sendMessage()
3. SimpleOperator.checkStatus()
   (Operator determines if response is success/blocked/failed)
4. If success: emit step_complete
   -> WorkflowMonitor.updateHeartbeat()
```

**Key Finding:** step_complete events DO go through SimpleOperator first. The operator evaluates the agent's response and determines success/failure before any events are emitted.

**Auto-Resume Strategy:**

- Silent failures detected via stale workflow monitoring
- Recovery triggered by re-invoking with same threadId
- LangGraph automatically resumes from last checkpoint
- All session IDs preserved for step continuity
- Completed steps automatically skipped

**Current Limitations:**

- Event-based, not true heartbeat monitoring
- Steps taking >2 minutes falsely detected as stale
- No heartbeat during Claude SDK execution phase
- Would need SDK modification for true heartbeats

## Notes

- KISS: Start with simple SSE, add complexity only as needed
- DRY: Reuse existing WebSocket infrastructure for events
- Test First: Every feature needs API tests before UI
- Incremental: Each phase should be deployable independently
- Monitor: Add metrics for retry success rates
- **CRITICAL**: PostgresSaver is the foundation for true workflow reliability
- **SAFETY**: Never remove MemorySaver until 30 days of stable production use
