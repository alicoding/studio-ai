# Optimizations Summary

## Tab Switching Optimization

### Problem
- User reported that switching tabs causes unnecessary config reloads
- This impacted performance and user experience

### Solution Implemented

1. **Settings Cache with TTL**
   - Added module-level cache in `useSettings` hook
   - 5-minute cache duration prevents redundant API calls
   - Cache stores both config and hooks data
   - Initial state uses cached values if available

2. **React Performance Optimizations**
   - Wrapped SettingsPage in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Used useCallback for stable tab change handler
   - Removed loadSystemSettings from useEffect dependencies

3. **Lazy Tab Content Rendering**
   - Tab content only renders when active
   - Prevents hidden tabs from executing hooks or making API calls
   - Maintains tab state while optimizing performance

### Results
- Settings load only once on initial page mount
- Tab switching is now instant with no API calls
- Hidden tabs don't consume resources
- No side effects - all functionality preserved

### Code Changes
- `/src/hooks/useSettings.ts`: Added caching mechanism
- `/src/routes/settings.tsx`: Added memoization and lazy rendering
- Fixed TypeScript errors (Array.from for Set iteration)
- Removed debug console.log statements

### Testing
1. Open settings page - API call happens once
2. Switch between tabs - no additional API calls
3. Settings persist correctly
4. All tabs function normally when selected
